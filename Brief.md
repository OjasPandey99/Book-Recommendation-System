# Book-Recommendation-System
Here "Book RS" contains code for a basic recommendation system using the feature vectors for different books 
and "Book RS kNN" uses collaborative filtering using k-Nearest-neighbours technique to recommend books using user's profile.
It finds users/readers similar to you and then recommends the books highly rated by these users.
